# warehouseApplication
A school project to be used in two courses: User Interface Programming and Data Management Systems.

## User stories
As a user I want to:
- be able to add warehouses / rooms / spaces to database
- remove warehouses from database
- search by product name
- search by product#
- search by product location if installed in field / in production
- search by quantity
- add an indentified product to warehouse table
- remove an item from warehouse
- mark the location to an indentified product if in service
- add supplies to warehouse table

## Programming language and database
Since the course is build around Java and JavaFX it'll be used as language.

Data management course uses MariaDB and course project will be a relational database, so having a simple MariaDB compatible api is the first target in this project.
